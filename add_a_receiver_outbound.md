## Proof of Compliance \(AoC\)

The PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance \(AoC\) is a mandatory document that we need to connect with another API in order to forward plain credit card data to that API.

As a business owner, it is your responsibility to make sure you are partnering with the right service providers \(Receiver\). Knowing your partners compliance status provides assurance and awareness about how they deal with cardholder data of your customers. The PCI DSS Attestations of Compliance \(AOC\) is the only official document recognized for PCI DSS validation. Any other forms of certification issued for the purposes of illustrating compliance to PCI DSS are not acceptable for proving compliance.
