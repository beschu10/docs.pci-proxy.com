# Quickstart: Collect card data from a website

The inline mode allows you to securely collect card data by injecting iframes to your DOM. A separate iframe for the card number and CVV code is used. Like this, sensitive data never reaches your server.

Below you can find a preview of a sample payment form.

```
<script>alert('Hello World');</script>

<style>
    #my-header {
        background: #333; color: #fff;
    }
</style>

<h1 id="my-header">Hello World</h1>
```
