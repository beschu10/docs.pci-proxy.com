## Security Signs

For every request you make against our PCI Proxy, we ask for your security sign. It is a digital signature that tells us that it is really you and secures the data transmission. We differentiate between the following two:

| Statig Sign1 \(X-CC-SIGN\) | Dynamic Sign2 \(SHA HASH\) |
| --- | --- |
| Our [Webservice \(XML/SOAP\) Proxy](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/webservice.html), the [Forward Proxy](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/forward.html) and our [Charge API](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/charge.html) need a static sign. You send it as X-CC-SIGN in the http header with every webservice call \(collect or forward\). When you sign up for the developer test account, we set the  _X-CC-SIGN_ for you. You can change it any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under _“UPP Administration” / “Security”_ | Our [Website/Application interface](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/website-application.html) and our [Show interface](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/show.html) need a dynamic digital signature. You can generate the sign with a standard HMAC-SHA-256 hash procedure and using a merchant-specific encryption key. The HMAC key is generated by the system and can be changed at any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under _“UPP Administration” / “Security” / “Other Services”._ The key is delivered in hexadecimal format, and it should also be stored in this format. Before its usage the key must be translated into byte format. |

> \*You can generate the sign2 as follows: `SHA.256(salt+merchantId+aliasCC)`
>
> Translate HMAC key from hex to byte format. Create string to be signed by concatenating of parameters in the following order and without separators:
>
> * salt
> * merchantId
> * aliasCC
