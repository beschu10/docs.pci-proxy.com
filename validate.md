# Validate Credit Cards

After collection you might want to confirm payment data is valid and can be charged. 

To avoid fraudulent or invalid payment data, PCI Proxy allows you to conduct card validity checks and validate collected payment data. 

The payment data is checked through Datatrans payment gateway against the card scheme networks and notifies if payment data is valid at that point in time.
