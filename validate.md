# Validate Credit Cards

After collecting and tokenizing credit cards you might want to confirm that the credit card is still valid and can be charged at a later point in time. 

To avoid fraudulent or invalid credit cards, PCI Proxy allows you to conduct card validity checks and validate collected credit cards by using the token. 

The credit card is checked through Datatrans payment gateway against the card scheme networks and notifies if the credit card number is valid at that point in time.
