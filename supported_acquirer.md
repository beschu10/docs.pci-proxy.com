# Supported Acquirer

If you want to charge credit cards and make a transaction against stored credit cards, you need an acceptance contract with an acquirer. 


> An acquirer is a bank of financial institution that processes credit or debit card transactions on behalf of you. The acquirer will either approve or decline the debit or credit card purchase amount. If approved the acquirer will then settle the transaction by placing the funds into your account.
