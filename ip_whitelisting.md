# IP Whitelisting


Some services may prevent unauthorized access to their servers. In that case, only whitelisted IP addresses are allowed to connect. For instance, Booking.com is asking to enter source IPs.

If possible, please whitelist our full Class C network:

```
193.16.220.0/24 
91.223.186.0/24
92.```


Depending on how restrictive you want to setup the whitelist, you can also specify only the following IPs:


```
193.16.220.3
193.16.220.4
193.16.220.16
193.16.220.152
193.16.220.153
91.223.186.4```
