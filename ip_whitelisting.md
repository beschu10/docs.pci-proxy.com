# IP Whitelisting


Some services may prevent unauthorized access to their servers. Only whitelisted IP addresses are allowed to connect. 

Please use the following IP addresses for whitelisting:

| Name | Address |
| -- | -- |
| sftp.datatrans.biz | 193.16.220.16 |
| pilot.datatrans.biz | 193.16.220.3 |
| payment.datatrans.biz | 193.16.220.4 |
| payment.datatrans2.biz | 91.223.186.4  |


Depending on how restrictive you want to setup the whitelist, you can also whitelist our full Class C networks. Especially sftp-proxy could switch to 91.223.186 subnet in case of a emergency. For a full Class C network whitelist, please use 193.16.220.0/24 and 91.223.186.0/24.
