# Collect Payment Data

Whether you receive payment data via API, accept credit cards on a website or collect them in a mobile app, you can use PCI Proxy APIs.

Our APIs automatically tokenize the payment information before they ever touch your systems to instantly reduce your PCI scope. 

PCI Proxy APIs are organized in environments, meaning the different ways on how you could possibly receive or collect payment data.
