# Features

PCI Proxy has 3 major features: Collect, Validate, Use. 

|Collect|Validate|Use|
|---|---|---|
|from web service|credit card check|Forward|
|from website||Charge|
|from mobile app||Retrieve|

## Collect

To keep sensitive payment data from touching your systems, you need to collect payment data with our APIs.
They will automatically tokenize the payment data before it is sent to your system.

In general, there are three universes in which you might receive payment data. 

| Web Service | Web Interface | Mobile App |
| -- | -- | -- |
| XML / SOAP / JSON / etc. | Website / Application | iOS / Android |


*If you have specific environments that are not listed, please get in touch. We are quick and flexible to enhance our Proxy features. *

## Validate

After collection you might want to confirm payment data is valid and can be charged.

## Utilize

Eventually, you have collected payment data, to make use of it. 

| PCI Proxy allows you to... |
| -- |
| *charge payment data* directly through a payment gateway (e.g. Datatrans) |
| *forward payment data* to PCI-compliant third-parties (e.g. Expedia) |
| *retrieve single payment data sets* (e.g. to book a No-Show) |
