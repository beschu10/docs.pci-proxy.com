# Welcome to PCI Proxy

Here you will find information on how to integrate with and use the PCI Proxy. We have tried to make the documentations as simple and example-filled as possible, so let's check it out !

## Overview

Before we get started, take a minute and let us introduce you to the magic of PCI Proxy.  

PCI Proxy is a tokenization service that allows you to reduce your PCI scope. 

Our webservice API securely **extracts credit cards out of XML/SOAP calls. ** Your XML/SOAP requests and responses remain unchanged. *For instance, you receive XML reservation data from [Booking.com](http://www.booking.com/) that contain credit cards.* 

Our payment page APIs let you **collect payment data on websites or mobile apps**. 

By using tokenization, our APIs ensure **sensitive payment data never touch your systems**. Tokens can be used like normal credit cards. You can validate, forward or charge them. Our APIs detokenize them automatically for processing.

### Overview of major features: Collect, Validate, Use.
