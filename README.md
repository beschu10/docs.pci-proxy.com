This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to PCI Proxy. 

## What is PCI Proxy?

PCI Proxy is an API toolbox that allows you to instantly reduce your PCI scope.

You can securely collect, store and forward credit cards (payment data) to payment gateways (e.g. Datatrans or Stripe) or PCI-compliant third parties (e.g. Expedia).

You can even **extract payment data from XML/SOAP calls** (e.g. Booking.com). 

By using tokenization, our APIs ensure **sensitive payment data never touches your system environment**.
