This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to PCI Proxy. We will cover topics on who and why 

## What is PCI Proxy?

PCI Proxy is Tokenization as a Service. A toolbox of easy-to-integrate APIs to instantly reduce your PCI scope.

You can **securely collect, store and forward credit cards** (payment data) to payment gateways (e.g. Datatrans or Stripe) or PCI-compliant third parties (e.g. Expedia).

You can even **extract payment data out of web service calls** (e.g. Booking.com) while allowing the message body to remain unaffected. 

By using tokenization, our APIs ensure **sensitive payment data never touches your system environment**.
