# iOS / Android

Let us assume you offer a native mobile app to your customers where they can enter payment data.

`Our SDKs for iOS and Android collect payment data in native apps` and automatically store it in our secure vault.A reference number (token) is issued and sent to your systems. +

*You are allowed to store the token in your system, as it is not PCI DSS relevant.*

The token can be used later on to charge, forward or retrieve payment data.

*Add-on: Our SDKs have a built-in feature to instantly charge payment data. All you need is an existing acquiring contract.*

**All SDKs assure your servers never get in touch with sensitive card data to reduce your PCI scope to the least.**
