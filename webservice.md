# Collect payment data from XML/SOAP calls

Let us assume you receive or request messages with sensitive data via API from your partners (channel).

`By switching PCI Proxy between you and the channel`, payment data is extracted and automatically stored in our secure vault. A reference number (token) is issued that substitutes the payment data in the request or response. The message structure of the channel API always remains the same. 

*You are allowed to store the token in your system, as it is not PCI DSS relevant.*

The token can be used later on to charge, forward or retrieve payment data. All happens before sensitive payment data ever touch your server to reduce your PCI scope.

## How to start

In general, you either perform a pull request to receive data or a channel pushes data to your server. PCI Proxy can extract payment data from both.

### Perform a pull request against another API



**Consider a business that needs this ability:**

*You are a travel technology company pulling new reservations from portals such as Booking.com. As reservations may contain payment data, Booking.com asks for your PCI DSS compliance.*

*By using PCI Proxy, Booking.com removes this requirement from you, because we as a company are PCI DSS compliant and you can bank on our full Level 1 PCI DSS compliance.*



#### Quick Start Guide:

1. Add a pull channel to your account
2. POST your XML/SOAP request having PCI Proxy as endpoint.
2. Add HTTP header to your request.


- PCI Proxy Endpoint: ```https://pilot.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/pull```
- Required HTTP header:


| HTTP Header      | Description                                                        | Example value
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------| ---
| `X-CC-URL` | Specifies the target (channel) URL that will be called | https://api.partner.com/
| `X-CC-MERCHANT-ID` | Your merchant ID | 1000011011
| `X-CC-SIGN` | Configured security sign | 130709090849785405
            

```java
    $ curl "https://pilot.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/pull" 
        -X POST 
        -H "Content-Type: text/xml" 
        -H "X-CC-MERCHANT-ID: 1100005433" 
        -H "X-CC-URL: https://api.partner.com/" 
        -H "X-CC-SIGN: 160203112421662698" 
        -d 'yourRequest.xml'```
        
        
## You receive a request from a partner


**Consider a business that needs this ability:**

*You are a travel technology company receiving new reservations from booking portals on an API endpoint at your server. As reservations may contain sensitive payment data, your servers are in PCI scope.*

*With the use of PCI Proxy, payment data ever touch your server and your reduce your PCI scope.* 

#### Quick Start Guide

To switch PCI Proxy between you and a channel that pushes data, you just add a new channel. The channel can use it and invoke requests having PCI Proxy as endpoint.

1. Add a new push channel to your account.
2. Exchange old API endpoint with new PCI Proxy API endpoint at your partner


- PCI Proxy Endpoint: ```https://pilot.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/push/219e781e517d447c``` 



## Add a new channel

Adding a new channel is easy. Please send the following information to [setup@pci-proxy.com](mailto:setup@pci-proxy.com). 

|Information| Description   |
|---|---|
|Channel Type|Define if it is a push or pull channel.|
|Target URL|The URL where we should forward the request to.|
|Sample Request & Response|Please include API name, required headers, auth fields, and request method.|

You will receive a confirmation once the channel is successfully added. For push channels, you also receive a channel specific API endpoint.

  
  
#### How to start
Once your tests are successful, you can [activate your API endpoint](activate-push-endpoint) and receive the productive API endpoint.

This push URL is hosted in our PCI Proxy pilot environment to let you test the push channel and make sure you receive the correct data. 


### Supported channel APIs

We support a variety of channel APIs out of the box. Every day, more and more channels get added. Please find below an uncomplete list of channels we already support. In case your required API is not on the list, adding a new channel API is easy. 

    Booking.com â€“ cURL example 

**Adding a new pull channel API**

If your required channel API is not supported yet, you can easily add new pull channel APIs by yourself. Just send us the following information to setup@pci-proxy.com. 

|Information| Description   |
|---|---|
|Target URL|The URL where we should forward the request to.|
|Sample Request & Response|Please include API name, required headers, auth fields, and request method.|


**Activate API endpoint**
Once your tests are successful, you can activate it by sending the following data to setup@pci-proxy.com.

|Information| Description   |
|---|---|
|Merchant ID|Once you [register an account](register) you receive your merchant ID.|
|API Endpoint|Test API endpoint that should be activated|

In return you will receive a unique production push URL for the new push channel that you can pass on to your partner.
