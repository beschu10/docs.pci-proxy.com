## Live Mode and Testing

PCI Proxy accounts are divided into two environments, namely test and production. All your API requests and testing go through our test environment until you activate your account. 

The test environment gives you the opportunity to test the PCI Proxy and make sure you receive the correct data. 

In test mode, you can only use [test credit cards](https://www.datatrans.ch/showcase/test-cc-numbers). 

You can differentiate test and production environment based on the URL.

 
 | Environment |URL |
| -- | -- |
| PROD: | `https://production.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |
 | TEST: | `https://pilot.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |

 Once your tests are successful, please [activate your account](activate-account) and receive your productive credentials.
 
## Activate your account

Once your tests are successful, you can activate your account. Just send the following data to [setup@pci-proxy.com](mailto:setup@pci-proxy.com):

|Information| Description   |
|---|---|
|Merchant ID|Once you  you receive your merchant ID.|
|API Endpoint|Test API endpoint that should be activated|



In return you will receive a unique production push URL for the new push channel that you can pass on to your partner.
