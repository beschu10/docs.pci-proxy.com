# Developer Test Account

[Sign up](http://www.pci-proxy.com/) for a developer test account to start testing in our test environment.

You will receive the following demo credentials:

 | Credential | Description |
| -- | -- |
| MerchantID | Identifies your environment at PCI Proxy. |
 | X-CC-SIGN | It's a security parameter. You will need to sign your webservice calls when you collect or forward payment data. |
  | Login | Username & Password to login to our [web admin tool](https://pilot.datatrans.biz/). In our [web admin tool](https://pilot.datatrans.biz/) you can set and change the security signs.  |

### Web Administration Tool

Our web admin tool gives you a comprehensive management tool (backoffice) for initiating charges and credits, analysing of transactions, creation of reports and management of configuration data.

### Security signs

For every request you make against our PCI Proxy, we ask for your security sign. It is a digital signature that tells us that it is really you and secures the data transmission. We differentiate between the following two:

**Static Sign (X-CC-SIGN):** Our webservice needs a static sign. You send it as X-CC-SIGN in the http header with every webservice call (collect or forward). When you sign up for the developer test account, we set the  *X-CC-SIGN* for you. You can change it any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under *“UPP Administration” / “Security”*.

**Dynamic Sign (SHA Hash): **
Our interfaces need a dynamic digital signature. You can generate the sign with a standard HMAC-SHA-256 hash procedure and using a merchant-specific encryption key. The HMAC key is generated by the system and can be changed at any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz).

It is built as follows: `SHA.256(salt+merchantId+aliasCC)`

 merchant administration tool

 With every change of the key, the interface accepts signature based on the current key only!
 The key is delivered in hexadecimal format, and it should also be stored in this format.
But before its usage the key must be translated into byte format!
 “sign2” is only returned in success case 

- translate HMAC key from hex to byte format
- create string to be signed by concatenating of parameters
- merchantId
- amount
- currency
- refno
in exactly this order and without separators
 sign the string using HMAC-SHA-256 procedure based on merchant’s HMAC key
 translate signature from byte to hex format and associate it as value with parameter sign

&salt=xUWnv6TR0RqUyPsVWvxgUn0wXKCuPJjWAumgTy67TVUsimiL0V

Generate the *salt* value in our [backend](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under *“UPP Administration” / “Security” / “Other Services”*.


##Live and Testing

PCI Proxy accounts are divided into two environments, namely test and production. 

All your API requests and testing go through our test environment until you activate your account. 

In test mode, you can only use [test credit cards](https://www.datatrans.ch/showcase/test-cc-numbers). 

You can differentiate test and production environment based on the URL.

 
 | Environment |URL |
| -- | -- |
| PROD: | `https://production.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |
 | TEST: | `https://pilot.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |


 
## Activate your account

Once your tests are successful, please activate your account to receive your productive credentials. Send the following data to [setup@pci-proxy.com](mailto:setup@pci-proxy.com):

|Information| Description   |
|---|---|
|Merchant ID|Once you  you receive your merchant ID.|

You will receive your productive merchant ID and depending on your set up productive push URLs. you can pass on to your partner.
