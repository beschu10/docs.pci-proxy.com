# Developer Test Account

[Sign up](http://www.pci-proxy.com/) for a developer test account to start testing in our test environment.

You will receive the following demo credentials:

 | Credential | Description |

### Security signs

For every request you make against our PCI Proxy, we ask for your security sign. It is a digital signature that tells us that it is really you and secures the data transmission. We differentiate between the following two:

**Static Sign1 (X-CC-SIGN):** Our webservice needs a static sign. You send it as X-CC-SIGN in the http header with every webservice call (collect or forward). When you sign up for the developer test account, we set the  *X-CC-SIGN* for you. You can change it any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under *“UPP Administration” / “Security”*.

**Dynamic Sign2 (SHA Hash): **
Our interfaces need a dynamic digital signature. You can generate the sign with a standard HMAC-SHA-256 hash procedure and using a merchant-specific encryption key. The HMAC key is generated by the system and can be changed at any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under *“UPP Administration” / “Security” / “Other Services”.* The key is delivered in hexadecimal format, and it should also be stored in this format. Before its usage the key must be translated into byte format.

> You can generate the sign2 as follows: `SHA.256(salt+merchantId+aliasCC)`

> Translate HMAC key from hex to byte format. Create string to be signed by concatenating of parameters in the following order and without separators:
- salt
- merchantId
- aliasCC


##Live and Testing

PCI Proxy accounts are divided into two environments, namely test and production. 

All your API requests and testing go through our test environment until you activate your account. 

In test mode, you can only use [test credit cards](https://www.datatrans.ch/showcase/test-cc-numbers). 

You can differentiate test and production environment based on the URL.

 
 | Environment |URL |
| -- | -- |
| PROD: | `https://production.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |
 | TEST: | `https://pilot.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |
