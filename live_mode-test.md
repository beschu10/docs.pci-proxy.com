##Live and Testing

PCI Proxy accounts are divided into two environments, namely test and production. 

All your API requests and testing go through our test environment until you activate your account. 

In test mode, you can only use [test credit cards](https://www.datatrans.ch/showcase/test-cc-numbers). 

You can differentiate test and production environment based on the URL.

 
 | Environment |URL |
| -- | -- |
| PROD: | `https://sandbox.pci-proxy.com/v1/` |
 | TEST: | `https://api-pci-proxy.com/v1/` |
