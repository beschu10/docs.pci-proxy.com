# Live Mode and Testing

PCI Proxy accounts are divided into two environments, namely test and production. All your API requests and testing go through our test environment until you [activate your account](activate-account). 

The test environment gives you the opportunity to test the PCI Proxy and make sure you receive the correct data. 

In test mode, you can only use [test credit cards](https://www.datatrans.ch/showcase/test-cc-numbers). 

You can differentiate test and production environment based on the URL.

 
 | Environment |URL |
| -- | -- |
| PROD: | `https://production.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |
 | TEST: | `https://pilot.datatrans.biz/upp/proxy/` |

 Once your tests are successful, please [activate your account](activate-account) and receive your productive credentials.
