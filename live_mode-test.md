### Sandbox (Test) Environment

Sandbox Endpoint: https://sandbox.pci-proxy.com/v1/

Before taking your integration live, use our sandbox environment to test it thoroughly. The PCI Proxy sandbox environment is a self-contained testing environment, designed to simulate our production environment. Please note, in test mode you can only use test credit cards.

## Security Signs

For every request you make against our PCI Proxy, we ask for your security sign. It is a digital signature that tells us that it is really you and secures the data transmission. We differentiate between the following two:

|Statig Sign1 (X-CC-SIGN)| Dynamic Sign2 (SHA HASH)   |
|---|---|
|Our [Webservice (XML/SOAP) Proxy](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/webservice.html), the [Forward Proxy](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/forward.html) and our [Charge API](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/charge.html) need a static sign. You send it as X-CC-SIGN in the http header with every webservice call (collect or forward). When you sign up for the developer test account, we set the  *X-CC-SIGN* for you. You can change it any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under *“UPP Administration” / “Security”*|Our [Website/Application interface](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/website-application.html) and our [Show interface](https://docs.pci-proxy.com/show.html) need a dynamic digital signature. You can generate the sign with a standard HMAC-SHA-256 hash procedure and using a merchant-specific encryption key. The HMAC key is generated by the system and can be changed at any time in our [web admin tool](http://pilot.datatrans.biz) under *“UPP Administration” / “Security” / “Other Services”.* The key is delivered in hexadecimal format, and it should also be stored in this format. Before its usage the key must be translated into byte format.|


> *You can generate the sign2 as follows: `SHA.256(salt+merchantId+aliasCC)`

> Translate HMAC key from hex to byte format. Create string to be signed by concatenating of parameters in the following order and without separators:
- salt
- merchantId
- aliasCC
