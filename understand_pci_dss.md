# Understand PCI DSS

Everyone storing, processing or transmitting sensitive card data is required to comply with PCI DSS.

Even if you use certified third party providers to handle your sensitive card data, you always need to proof your compliance. 

PCI Proxy can reduce your efforts for PCI compliance to the minimal requirements. 

Thereby you avoid building your own PCI compliant environment and save costs and time.


## How to proof your compliance?

```DEPENDS ON HOW YOU HANDLE SENSITIVE DATA.```

| Handling sensitive card data yourself | Use tokenization as a service |
| -- | -- |
| If you handle sensitive cardholder data by yourself, you need to prove your compliance by conducting full onsite audits or completing SAQ D with 286 requirements annually plus performing quarterly network scans by approved scanning vendors. This is depending on the number of transactions you process yearly. | With PCI Proxy you generally prove your compli-ance by relying on Datatransâ€™ PCI DSS Level 1 certification and fill out only a reduced Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).  |
 
The ultimate requirements are finally dictated by your acquirer/bank.
