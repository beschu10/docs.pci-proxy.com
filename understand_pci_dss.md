# Understand PCI DSS

You will learn who needs to be compliant and how you can achieve PCI DSS compliant.

Storing and handling sensitive payment data can be a tough try and it makes you a great target. 

## Who needs to comply with PCI DSS?

*Everyone storing, processing or transmitting sensitive card data* is required to comply with PCI DSS.

Even if you use certified third party providers to handle your sensitive card data, *you always need to proof your compliance.* 

PCI Proxy can reduce your efforts for PCI compliance to the minimal requirements. 

Thereby you avoid building your own PCI compliant environment and save costs and time.


## How to proof your compliance?

> Depends on how you handle sensitive payment data.

| Handling sensitive card data yourself | Use tokenization as a service |
| -- | -- |
| By handling sensitive payment data by yourself, you need to prove your compliance by conducting full onsite audits or completing SAQ D with 286 requirements annually plus performing quarterly network scans by approved scanning vendors. This is depending on the number of transactions you process yearly. | With PCI Proxy you generally prove your compliance by relying on Datatransâ€™ PCI DSS Level 1 certification. You can just fill out a reduced Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).  |
 
Eventually, the ultimate requirements are dictated by your acquirer/bank.
