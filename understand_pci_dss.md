# Understand PCI DSS

Learn who needs to be PCI DSS compliant and how you can achieve PCI DSS compliance.

Storing and handling sensitive payment data can be a tough try and it makes you a great target. 

## Who needs to comply with PCI DSS?

*Everyone storing, processing or transmitting sensitive card data* is required to comply with PCI DSS.

Even if you use certified third party providers to handle your sensitive card data, *you always need to proof your compliance.* 

> PCI Proxy can reduce your efforts for PCI compliance to the minimal requirements. 

Thereby you avoid building your own PCI compliant environment and save costs and time.


## How to proof your compliance?

It depends on how you handle sensitive payment data. Eventually, it is dictated by your acquirer/bank.

| Handling sensitive card data yourself | Use tokenization as a service |
| -- | -- |
| You need to prove your compliance by conducting full onsite audits or completing SAQ D with 286 requirements annually plus performing quarterly network scans by approved scanning vendors (Depends on the number of transactions you process yearly). | With PCI Proxy you generally prove your compliance by relying on Datatransâ€™ PCI DSS Level 1 certification. You can just fill out a reduced Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).  |
 



## Which SAQ is applicable to you?

If you have decided whether you want to handle sensitive card data yourself or use PCI Proxy to take care of your sensitive data, you fill out one of the relevant SAQs for online merchants:
