# Getting Started

Here is a quick start guide on how to use PCI Proxy and quickly reduce your PCI scope.

 1. [Sign up](signup) for a free test account.
 2. [Choose API](collect_payment_data.html) to collect or extract payment data.
 3. [Explore features](features.html), e.g. [confirm](validate.html), [charge](charge.html), [forward](forward.html) or [retrieve](retrieve.html) payment data.
 3. After successful testing, [activate your account](activate_account.html) and reduce your PCI scope.

*Before you activate your account, you can use PCI Proxy for free in test mode. With the exception that only [test credit cards](https://www.datatrans.ch/showcase/test-cc-numbers) can be used, all PCI Proxy features are fully available in test mode.*

#### Important: Your merchant ID

On the following pages you will find several sample scripts that run on our test environment. You will notice the merchant ID attribute. Merchant IDs are unique API keys that will identify your environments at PCI Proxy when you [sign up](signup). 

You can have many merchant IDs. For instance, if you have different environments on which you receive payment data (e.g. website, web service, mobile app), we recommend separating your environments by using a single merchant ID for each.

To go live, you will need to replace the test API key with a production API key. You can get your production keys by [registering an account at PCI Proxy](register).
