# Getting Started

Here is a quick step-by-step instruction on how to get started and quickly reduce your PCI scope.

 1. Collect or extract payment data with our APIs 
 2. Use stored payment data
 
#### Important: Your API key (merchant ID)

On the following pages you will find several sample scripts that run on our test environment. You will notice the merchant ID attribute. Merchant IDs are unique API keys that will identify your environments at PCI Proxy once you are registered. 

You can have many merchant IDs. For instance, if you have different environments on which you receive payment data (e.g. website, web service, mobile app), we recommend separating your environments by using a single merchant ID for each.

> For your convenience, we have pre-filled our examples with a test API key so you can start off testing right away.

To [go live](golive), you will need to replace the test API key with a production API key. You can get your production keys by [registering an account at PCI Proxy](register).
