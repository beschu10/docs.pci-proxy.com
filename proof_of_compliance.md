# Proof of PCI Compliance

As a business owner, it is your responsibility to make sure you are partnering with the right service providers. Knowing your partners compliance status provides assurance and awareness about how they use cardholder data of your customers.

The document you need for the compliance validation is the** Attestation of Compliance (AOC).** In addition, the service provider has to sign a** written agreement** taking responsibility for cardholder data on your behalf.


## What we need for the proof of compliance?

When you are using the PCI Proxy, we need the following documents from your service providers to be able to forward cardholder to them.


| Attestation of Compliance (AOC) | Letter of Acknowledgment |
| -- | -- |
| The Attestations of Compliance (AOC) is the only official document recognized for PCI DSS validation. Any other forms of certification issued for the purposes of illustrating compliance to PCI DSS are not acceptable for proving compliance.| The written agreement should promote a consistent level of understanding between the service provider and Datatrans and their responsibilities. With the agreement, the service providers evidences their commitment to maintaining proper security of cardholder data that it obtains from Datatrans on behalf of its clients.     |
