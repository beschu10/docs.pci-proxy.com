# Proof of Compliance

As a business owner, it is your responsibility to make sure you are partnering with the right service providers. Knowing your service providers PCI DSS compliance status provides assurance and awareness about whether they comply with the same requirements that your organization is subject to.  

The formal document you need for proof PCI compliance is the Attestation of Compliance (AOC). In addition to the Attestation of Compliance (AOC), the service provider has to maintain a written agreement that includes an acknowledgment that the service providers are responsible for the security of cardholder data the service pro-viders possess or otherwise store, process or transmit on behalf of the customer.

If you perfom a request against a service provider (3rd party) we need the following documents for the validation of PCI DSS compliance:

 **What we need: **

-	Attestation of Compliance (AOC):

The Attestations of Compliance (AOC) is the only official document recognized for PCI DSS validation. Any other form of certificate or documentation issued for the purposes of illustrating compliance to PCI DSS or any other PCI standard are not authorized and their use is not acceptable for evidencing compli-ance. 

-	Letter of Acknowledgment: 

With the acknowledgement, the service providers evidences their commitment to maintaining proper security of cardholder data that it obtains from Datatrans on behalf of its clients. The Letter of Acknowledgement should promote a consistent level of understanding between the service provider and Datatrans about their applicable PCI DSS responsibilities. This includes for example the maintaining of their PCI DSS compliance and immediately notification I case of a non-compliance status (Require-ments and Security Assessment Procedures, Version 3.2, Requirement 12.8.2.)
